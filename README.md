# New York Data Analysis

* In this repository, I use the famous NY taxi dataset, that records taxi trips for the months of July and November of 2015.
* I derive significant insights from this dataset, especially the prediction on the fare amount.

# Repository elements

This repository contains:
* The dataset used
* A Jupyter notebook in which I attempt to predict the fare amount paid.
